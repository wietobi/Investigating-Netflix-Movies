Hi, this is my first repository on Git. As of today I used the Data Camp Learning plattform and decided to post my personal solutions to their projects. 

What is the project about?
A. Exploring the dataset and trying to figure out, if the average duration of movies has been declinig between the years of 1940 till 2021. 

What skills are required?
A:  Basic knowledge on Python, including importing .csv files, subsetting, loops and working with tabular data. Two packages are needed: Pandas as a foundation for data wrangling and manipulation, plus Matplotlib for visualization. 
Matplotlib is only needed at the end of the project to make visually appealing representations of the data. Roughly 80% of the work is done with pandas.
